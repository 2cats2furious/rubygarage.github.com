  <h2>Invoking tasks</h2>
  <p>
    You may at some point want to invoke a task from inside another task. Letâ€™s say, for example, you wanted to make coffee in the afternoon, too. If you need an extra upper after lunch you could do that the following way:
  </p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[
    # file Rakefile
    ...
    namespace :afternoon do
      task :make_coffee do
        Rake::Task['morning:make_coffee'].invoke
        puts "Ready for the rest of the day!"
      end
    end]]>
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    <![CDATA[
    rake afternoon:make_coffee
    Made a cup of coffee. Shakes are gone.
    Ready for the rest of the day!]]>
  </script>
