  <h2>Redefining tasks</h2>
  <p>
    Letâ€™s say you want to add on to an existing task. Perhaps you have another item in your grooming routine like styling your hair. You could write another task and slip it in as a dependency for groom_myself but you could also redefine groom_myself.

  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    namespace :morning do
      task :groom_myself do
        puts "Brushed teeth."
        puts "Showered."
        puts "Shaved."
      end
    end
    
    namespace :morning do
      task :groom_myself do
        puts "Styled hair."
      end
    end
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake morning:groom_myself
    Brushed teeth.
    Showered.
    Shaved.
    Styled hair.
