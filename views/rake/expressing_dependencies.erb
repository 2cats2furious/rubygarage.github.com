    Turned off alarm. Would have liked 5 more minutes, though.
    Brushed teeth.
    Showered.
    Shaved.
    Made a cup of coffee. Shakes are gone.
    Dog walked.
    Ready for the day!]]>

  <p>
    By running the <i>ready_for_the_day</i> task it notices that the <i>turn_off_alarm</i>, <i>groom_myself</i>, <i>make_coffee</i>, and <i>walk_dog</i> tasks are all prerequisites of the <i>ready_for_the_day</i> task. Then it runs them all in the appropriate order.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dependencies can be specified not only when defining the task, but also later, depending on the run time conditions.
