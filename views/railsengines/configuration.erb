  <p>Besides the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/railtie.rb" target="_blank">Railtie</a> configuration which is shared across the application, in a Rails::Engine you can access autoload_paths, eager_load_paths and autoload_once_paths, which, differently from a Railtie, are scoped to the current engine.</p>
