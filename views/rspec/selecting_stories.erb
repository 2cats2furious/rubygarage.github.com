  <h2>Selecting Stories</h2>
  <p>
    A great way to get started gathering user stories is to do a high-level brain dump of the sorts of things we might like to do. Here are some titles to get started:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start game</strong>
      <p>When a new game was started, the game generates secret code. The code should have 4 items.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker submits guess</strong>
      <p>The code-breaker propose a guess, and the system replies by marking the guess according to the marking algorithm.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker wins game</strong>
      <p>
       The code-breaker propose a guess that matches the secret code exactly. The system responds by marking the guess with four + signs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker loses game</strong>
      <p>
        After some number of turns, the game tells the code-breaker that the game is over (need to decide how many turns and whether to reveal the code).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker plays again</strong>
      <p>
        After the game is won or lost, the system prompts the code-breaker to play again. If the code-breaker indicates yes, a new game begins. If the code-breaker indicates no, the system shuts down.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker requests hint</strong>
      <p>
        At any time during a game, the code-breaker can request a hint, at which point the system reveals one of the numbers in the secret code.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker saves score</strong>
      <p>
        After the game is won or lost, the code-breaker can opt to save information about the game: who (initials?), how many turns, and so on.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
