  <h2>Data Clump</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The same two or three items frequently appear together in classes and parameter lists.</li>
    <li>A group of instance variable names start or end with similar substrings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Duplication:</strong> The recurrence of the items often means there is duplicate code spread around to handle them.</li>
    <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> There may be a missing concept, making the system harder to understand.</li>
  </ul>
