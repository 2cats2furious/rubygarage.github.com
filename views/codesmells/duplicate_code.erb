  <h2>Duplicated Code</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The easy form: Two fragments of code look nearly identical.</li>
    <li>The hard form: Two fragments of code have nearly identical effects (at any concep- tual level).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Size: The code is bigger than it has to be, with more to understand.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: A design concept expressed more than once interferes with future changes;
the change may have to be done in multiple places.</li>
    <li>Communication: Near-repetition interferes with how easily code is understood. (The
reader must decide whether two things are really expressing one concept, and whether any differences are significant.)</li>
  </ul>
