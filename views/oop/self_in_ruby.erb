  <h2>Self in Ruby</h2>
  <p>The keyword <strong>self</strong> in Ruby gives you access to the current object â€“ the object that is receiving the current message.</p>
  <h3>Self in instance method definitions</h3>
  <p>At the time the method definition is executed, the most you can say is that self inside this method will be some future object that has access to this method.<p/>

    s = S.new
