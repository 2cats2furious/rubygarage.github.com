## React.jsâ€™ data flow in one way

> The major benefit of this approach is that data flows throughout your app in a single direction and you have better control over it.
> Application state is contained in specific stores and as a result different components of your app remain loosely coupled.

# React Advantages

--

## Virtual DOM

> React uses virtual DOM which is JavaScript object.
> Virtual DOM provides a lightweight implementation of the DOM and events system.
> Instead of dealing with the browser, you manipulate an in-memory version of the DOM.
